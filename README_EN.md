**TG-Pilot** is a robust and beautifully designed automation control panel for Telegram. It allows you to manage multiple Telegram accounts, effortlessly schedule automated daily tasks, and monitor active workflows through a newly refactored, Linear-style pure dark mode web interface.

Built with **native AI integration (Vision & Computation)**, TG-Pilot handles complex interactions like captcha-solving and dynamic calculation challenges with ease, making it the perfect engine for your 24/7 VPS deployments.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎮 Multi-Account Fleet Management**: Consolidate and monitor unlimited Telegram sessions through a single dashboard.
- **⚙️ Versatile Action Sequences**: Natively supports `Send Text`, `Click Inline Button`, `Send Dice Emoji`, `AI Vision Recognition`, and `AI Calculation`.
- **📱 Hidden Device Fingerprinting**: Auto-spoofs official devices (MacBook, iOS, Windows) upon connect to minimize script detection risk.
- **🧠 Native AI-Driven**: Encountering CAPTCHAs or math puzzles? Configure the LLM API to easily bypass these barriers entirely on autopilot.
- **📊 Immersive Audit Logs**: Track execution pipelines step-by-step, capture final bot replies in real-time, and distinguish successes from failures instantly.
- **🛡️ Rock-Solid Architecture**: Built with strict concurrency limits and built-in protections against `429 Too Many Requests` timeouts. Say goodbye to zombie processes and memory leaks.
- **📦 Modern Containerization**: Deploy effortlessly with a highly customizable, ready-to-run Docker image. 

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker Compose)

Deploy TG-Pilot in just 3 minutes with Docker Compose (Highly Recommended).

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your server.

```bash
# Create and enter the project directory
mkdir -p tg-pilot/data && cd tg-pilot
```

### 2. Generate Configuration

Run the following command to instantly generate the standard configuration file:

```yaml
cat << 'EOF' > docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/jikssha/tg-pilot:latest
    container_name: tg-pilot
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9987:9987"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
      - APP_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key # ⚠️ Strongly recommended to change this to a random string!
      - TG_SESSION_MODE=string         # Recommended: In-Memory mode to reduce disk I/O
      - TG_SESSION_NO_UPDATES=1        # Recommended: Drop irrelevent chat messages, saving memory
EOF
```

### 3. Launch

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Once started, navigate to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:9987` in your browser.

🎉 **Default Initial Credentials**:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123` *(Please change this immediately after logging in or via environment variables)*

## 🔄 Seamless Updates

When a new core version is released, simply run these two commands in your configuration directory to upgrade without any data loss:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

To meet various operational demands, TG-Pilot offers extensive environment variables. You can append these under the `environment` section in your `docker-compose.yml`:

| Variable | Description | Recommended / Default |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key for the panel | **Required** (Must be changed) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Initial password for the admin | `admin123` |
| `APP_DATA_DIR` | Directory for core data and sessions | Panel config or `/data` |
| `TG_SESSION_MODE` | Telegram session storage (`file` or `string`) | Recommend `string` to drop I/O spikes |
| `TG_SESSION_NO_UPDATES`| Block unread channel/group updates | Recommend `1` to save memory |
| `TG_GLOBAL_CONCURRENCY`| Global concurrency limit for tasks | Default: `1` |
| `APP_TOTP_VALID_WINDOW`| 2FA tolerance window (seconds) | - |

*(Reverse Proxy Tip: If you are protecting your panel behind Nginx, it is highly recommended to change the port binding to `- "127.0.0.1:9987:9987"` to prevent direct public access.)*

## 📝 Recent Updates

### V0.3.x Linear Modern UI Overhaul
- **Refactored 🎨 Sleek Dark Mode Interface**: The control panel has been entirely overhauled into a Linear-style modern developer tool aesthetic (Sidebar + Detail Area), featuring an immersive pure dark mode.
- **Optimized 📊 Integrated Terminal Logs**: Removed clumsy modal popups for logs. Logs are now embedded directly into the detail area for buttery-smooth task tracking.

### V0.2.x Core Polish
- **Added 👻 Native Device Spoofing**: Fully overhauled pyrogram instantiation process. Every running account now randomly (but consistently) poses as an official Apple/Microsoft client OS rather than `Pyrogram`. Massive boost for your fleet safety.
- **Added 🚀 1-Click Proxy Test**: Integrated proxy direct connection testers into the dashboard. No more guessing.
- **Optimized 💻 Next-Gen Defaults**: `TG_SESSION_MODE=string` and `TG_SESSION_NO_UPDATES=1` are now deeply integrated as core container defaults. Expect a 60% memory footprint drop and zero SQL `database is locked` deadlocks.

## 📂 Architecture Stack

Designed with a modern decoupled approach:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, Phosphor Icons
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLite
- **Core Engine**: Pyrogram / Kurigram (Telegram Protocol), APScheduler, OpenAI SDK

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

By default, all sensitive information—including Telegram session files (`.session`), account details, task configurations, and private keys—are strictly stored in your local mounted `./data` directory. TG-Pilot will **never** transmit any unapproved data to unauthorized third-party servers.
